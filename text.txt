The story of how I adopted my first cat:

Back in Puerto Rico, I had recently lost my pet mouse due to unknown circumstances. 
After a few days of grieving, I decided to scroll through a Facebook 
group made for individuals to post cats up for adoption. 
Suddenly, I found this post about two little brothers up for adoption. 
I instantly fell in love with the little boy even though he lived across the island. 
I got in contact with the sweet lady who put him up for adoption, and funny twist, 
she thought I was the mom of two little girls (my sisters). 
She felt somewhat betrayed, however, I convinced my mom to 
speak with her in order to finalize the adoption.
After a few days, I had the chance to go up to San Juan and pick the little kitty up, 
and meet tons of foster cats the sweet lady had. That is how I got my first cat, onyx. :)
