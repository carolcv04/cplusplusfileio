The story how I adopted my first cat:

Back in Puerto Rico, I had recently lost my pet mouse due to unknown circumstances. After a few days of grieving, I decided to scroll through a Facebook 
group made for individuals to post cat up for adoption. Suddenly, I found this post about two little brother up for adoption. I instantly fell in love with the little boy even though
he lived across the island. I got in contact with the sweet lady that put him up for adoption, and funny twist, she thought I was the mom of two little girls (my sisters). She felt 
somewaht betrayed, however I convinced my mom to speak with her in order to finalize the adoption. After a few days, I had the chance to go up to San Juan and pick the little kitty up, 
and meet tons of fooster cats the sweet lady had. That is how I got my first cat, onyx. :)
