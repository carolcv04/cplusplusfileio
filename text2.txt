tHE STORY OF HOW i ADOPTED MY FIRST CAT:

bACK IN pUERTO rICO, i HAD RECENTLY LOST MY PET MOUSE DUE TO UNKNOWN CIRCUMSTANCES. 
aFTER A FEW DAYS OF GRIEVING, i DECIDED TO SCROLL THROUGH A fACEBOOK 
GROUP MADE FOR INDIVIDUALS TO POST CATS UP FOR ADOPTION. 
sUDDENLY, i FOUND THIS POST ABOUT TWO LITTLE BROTHERS UP FOR ADOPTION. 
i INSTANTLY FELL IN LOVE WITH THE LITTLE BOY EVEN THOUGH HE LIVED ACROSS THE ISLAND. 
i GOT IN CONTACT WITH THE SWEET LADY WHO PUT HIM UP FOR ADOPTION, AND FUNNY TWIST, 
SHE THOUGHT i WAS THE MOM OF TWO LITTLE GIRLS (MY SISTERS). 
sHE FELT SOMEWHAT BETRAYED, HOWEVER, i CONVINCED MY MOM TO 
SPEAK WITH HER IN ORDER TO FINALIZE THE ADOPTION.
aFTER A FEW DAYS, i HAD THE CHANCE TO GO UP TO sAN jUAN AND PICK THE LITTLE KITTY UP, 
AND MEET TONS OF FOSTER CATS THE SWEET LADY HAD. tHAT IS HOW i GOT MY FIRST CAT, ONYX. :)
